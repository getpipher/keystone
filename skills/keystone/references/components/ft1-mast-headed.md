### Ft1 · Mast-headed
A wordmark and tagline anchor a single horizontal band. Two or three small links beside, address or licence below.
*Use when:* the page has heavy content; the footer should be quiet and singular.
*Don't confuse with:* Ft2 Inline-rule (which is even more reduced).
**Gates:** G48 (token discipline — wordmark + links use `--font-*` and `--color-*` tokens, no inline values), G26 (links need interaction states).

```html
