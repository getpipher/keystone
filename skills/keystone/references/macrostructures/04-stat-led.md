## 04 · Stat-Led

The hero is a giant number — a metric, a count, a percentage. Everything that follows supports or qualifies it. Data is the narrative.

- **Heading:** large numeric display (8–12rem, tabular figures) **paired with a worded headline** — the figure is biggest, but never the hero's only words. State what the number means beside or beneath it.
- **Body:** sections each anchored by a supporting stat or chart.
- **Divider:** hairline rules between stat blocks; tabular-nums everywhere.
- **Button:** outlined chip aligned beneath the qualifier.
- **Image:** charts and small data-viz; no photography.
- **Reveal:** number-tick on the hero figure — counter from 0 to target over ~500ms.

Reach for it when the brief is "we have proof in numbers" — enterprise/B2B, fundraising platforms, climate or impact pages.

Avoid for products without a defensible single metric. A fake big number is worse than no number.

**The hero header always contains words.** The lead figure never stands alone — pair it with a worded line. A bare number as the dominant hero text fails gate 46.

**Gates that police this macro:** G46 (invented metrics — the stat must be real), G24 (off-scale spacing — tabular-nums + spacing scale).

Reference: Ahrefs, Stripe Sessions stat blocks, climate-impact dashboards, venture portfolio pages.

**Sample opening lines** (imitate the specificity — the number does the work):
> *"+47% · faster · decide late."* — number + three-word qualifier
> *"4 seconds. From the alert link to the slow span."* — pairs the number with what it bought
> *"434 total posts. New CSS you feel like you could use today."* — nerdy.dev — the count grounds the page
